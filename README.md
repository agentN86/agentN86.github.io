# agentn86's website
woah its my website!! You can check it out on [the github port](https://agentn86.github.io) or just actually go to [the actual website](https://agentn86.neocities.org).

## Features
* **The homepage:** I created the same homepage from Neocities to Github.
* **agent's gams:** My own "unblocked games" of sort. Using HTML5 and Ruffle, I made a small little website that is completely unblocked with *most* blockers. Check out [agents gams](https://agentn86.github.io/agentsgams) *please?*
* **Epic Boss Battle:** This is where EBB is hosted. You can play it on agents gams.
* **spooky horror books:** im too bothered to show a link, but please don't check this part out. its a bit *not spooky*.
* **README.md:** no way self aware??

Why not go check it out. It would be amazing (and rad, and stylish).
